Move to new ruby / rails version
================================

The vendor plugins are very old and the format of keeping 
them in a vendor dir is depricated.
rails-authorization-plugin
is a pain because it hasn't been worked on in years,
can we switch to using devise? Not sure if that would make 
existing users lose their passwords.

In the newer versions of rails the initialization / boot process
has changed.  We need to migrate the config files to the new format.


Time zone issues
================
The build only works on when using Pacific Ocean time zone.  Some where
in the tests (maybe the fixtures..?) there is a implicit assumption.
